About

Black Box is an abstract board game for one or two players, which simulates shooting rays into a black box to deduce the locations of "atoms" hidden inside.
It takes place on a 10x10 grid. Rows 0 and 9, and columns 0 and 9 (border squares), are used by the guessing player for shooting rays into the black box. The atoms are restricted to being within rows 1-8 and columns 1-8.
